    Question: What are german shepherds?
    Answer: The German Shepherd is a breed of medium to large-sized working dog that originated in Germany. In the English language, the breed's officially recognized name is German Shepherd Dog. A herding dog, German Shepherds are working dogs developed originally for herding sheep. Since that time, however, because of their strength, intelligence, trainability, and obedience, German Shepherds around the world are often the preferred breed for many types of work, including disability assistance, search-and-rescue, police and military roles and acting. The German Shepherd is the second-most registered breed by the American Kennel Club and seventh-most registered breed by The Kennel Club in the United Kingdom. German Shepherds were bred specifically for their intelligence. In a list of breeds most likely to bark as watchdogs, Stanley Coren ranked the breed in second place. Coupled with their strength, this trait makes the breed desirable as police, guard and search and rescue dogs.
    
    Question: What is the atomic number of Calcium?
    Answer: A calcium atom has 20 protons, 20 electrons and 20 neutrons. The atomic number or proton number of a chemical element is the number of protons found in the nucleus of every atom of that element. The atomic number uniquely identifies a chemical element. It is identical to the charge number of the nucleus. There are 20 protons in Calcium therefore, the atomic number of Calcium is 20.
    
    Question: How is an earthquake measured?
    Answer: A seismograph is the primary earthquake measuring instrument. The seismograph produces a digital graphic recording of the ground motion caused by the seismic waves. The digital recording is called seismogram. A network of worldwide seismographs detects and measures the strength and duration of the earthquake's waves. Earthquakes are measured using observations from seismographs. The magnitude of an earthquake and the intensity of shaking is usually reported on the Richter scale. The Richter Scale was invented by Charles Francis Richter in 1935 which approximates 10 different levels of earthquakes where anything less than 3 is minor and anything beyond 5 is risky.
    
    Question: Why is the sky blue?
    Answer: The sky is blue because its wavelengths are shorter, blue light is more strongly scattered than the longer-wavelength lights, red or green. Hence the result that when looking at the sky away from the direct incident sunlight, the human eye perceives the sky to be blue. because of the way the atmosphere interacts with sunlight. For instance, if sunlight passes through a transparent material, such as water, those light waves will refract, or bend, because light changes speed as it travels from one medium (air) to another (water). Human being has three different types of cones that divide up visual color information into red, green, and blue signals however, not every living creature have three cones that perceive the sky as blue. Other creatures can have more or less cones allowing them to perceive different set of colors, so objectively, the sky is not really blue, but to us humans, its blue.

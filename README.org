* Prompts
This is a free and open-source (FOSS) curation of prompts for OpenAI's GPT-3.

** The =.prompt= file format
This is the format I have used to organise
these prompts. It is =yaml= with a schema,
which is not yet defined.

This file is as good as any currently as an example of the schema.

** [[./prompts/meeting-bullets-to-summary.prompt]]

#+BEGIN_SRC yaml -n :async :results verbatim code
  title: "meeting bullet points to summary"
  prompt: |+
      Convert my short hand into a first-hand account of the meeting:

      <1>

      Summary:
  engine: "davinci-instruct-beta"
  temperature: 0.7
  max-tokens: 60
  top-p: 1
  frequency-penalty: 0.0
  presence-penalty: 0.0
  best-of: 1
  stop-sequences:
  - "\n\n"
  inject-start-text: yes
  inject-restart-text: yes
  show-probabilities: off
  # A flag just for convenience-sake to find prompts which are designed to be chatbots
  conversation-mode: no
  # Keep stitching together until reaching this limit
  # This allows a full response for answers which may need n*max-tokens to reach the stop-sequence.
  stitch-max: 0
  vars:
  - "notes"
  examples:

      Tom: Profits up 50%

      Kjel: Need more time to fix software

** Tooling
If you are looking for a tool which can load
and make use of these =.prompt= files
directly, you may use the =GPL-3= mode for
emacs that was used to generate them.

** Testing
*** TODO Use =cucumber= for test cases

* Prompts
This is a free and open-source curation of prompts for OpenAI's GPT-3.

** The =.prompt= file format
This is the format I have used to organise
these prompts. It is =yaml= with a schema,
which is not yet defined.

This file is as good as any currently as an example of the schema.

[[./prompts/meeting-bullets-to-summary.prompt]]

If you are looking for a tool which can load
and make use of these =.prompt= files
directly, you may use the =GPL-3= mode for
emacs that was used to generate them.
